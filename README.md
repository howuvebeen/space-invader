<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About The Project

This is the final project I've done for **CS 1100**, Introduction to Computing Using Python. I received 100 out of 100. 

The Pacxon version is one of the the most authentic Space Invader games. 

## Built With

* Python

## Game Rules

Win
* The last alien is destoryed

Lost
* The ship is destroyed and there are no lives remaining.
* Any alien touches the defensive line.

## Game Features

Aliens
* The aliens are arranged in rows and columns.
* They march back and forth across the screen, increasing speed as time goes.
* An alien chosen at random fires laser bolts. 
* They die when they collide with the laser bolt shot by the ship.

* At the bottom of the screen, there is a defense line.
* The ship can move horizontally and shoot a laser bolt at the aliens to attack. 

## Game States

* STATE_INACTIVE: Before the game starts, and the alien wave has not started
* STATE_NEWWAVE: When the aliens are set up, but have not started to move
* STATE_ACTIVE: While the game is ongoing, and the aliens are on the march
* STATE_PAUSED: While the game is paused (e.g. to show a message)
* STATE_CONTINUE: While the game is creating a new ship to replace the old one
* STATE_COMPLETE: After the game is over

## Extensions

* intro animation
* multiple waves
* implement sound effects
* dynamically speed up the aliens
* keep track of score
* animate the aliens
* defense barriers


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


## Prerequisites

* pip
* introcs
* kivy


## Running the Game

1. Click green Code button and download the zip file from github. 
2. Direct into a folder called invaders try the command ```python invaders```


<!-- CODE -->
# Code

These are some of the codes of I built for the game. To see more, refer to **app.py**, **wave.py**, and **models.py**.
